claim_id: "claim-002"

supersedes:
  claim_id: "claim-001"
  relationship: "replacement"
  rationale: >
    Claim 001 did not sufficiently constrain preprocessing steps and evaluation
    controls, leading to inconsistent results across runs. This claim refines the
    evaluation protocol and model specification to ensure reproducible and
    interpretable performance validation.

statement: >
  Model version v1.1 achieves an accuracy of at least 0.82 on dataset D when
  evaluated using a fixed preprocessing pipeline and a controlled, deterministic
  evaluation protocol.

metric:
  name: "accuracy"
  threshold: 0.82

subject:
  model_id: "model-v1.1"
  dataset_id: "dataset-D"

evaluation_context:
  task: "supervised classification"
  split: "held-out test set"
  preprocessing_pipeline: "fixed and versioned preprocessing steps"
  evaluation_protocol: "deterministic evaluation with controlled randomness"

notes:
  - This claim is the direct successor to claim-001.
  - It represents a refined formulation with stricter evaluation controls.
  - New evidence submissions should reference this claim_id for all future
    validation and lifecycle transitions.
