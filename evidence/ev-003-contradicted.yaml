  from: "supported"
  to: "contradicted"

evidence_type: "replication_failure"

summary: >
  This evidence reports a failed independent replication attempt in which the
  observed model performance does not meet the threshold declared in Claim 001.

observed_metrics:
  metric: "accuracy"
  value: 0.79
  threshold: 0.82
  comparator: ">="

submitted_artifacts:
  - artifact_id: "run-002"
    path: "../artifacts/run-002/"
    description: "Independent replication run artifacts including metrics, configuration, and environment information."

evaluation_context:
  model_id: "model-v1.0"
  dataset_id: "dataset-D"
  evaluation_protocol: "independent replication using different random seed"
  split: "held-out test set"

provenance:
  submitter: "external_researcher"
  submission_method: "manual_demo_submission"

notes:
  - The observed accuracy fails to satisfy the threshold declared in Claim 001.
  - This evidence contradicts the previously reported supporting evidence.
  - This transition demonstrates that claims may move backward in confidence
    without deleting or rewriting earlier validation history.
