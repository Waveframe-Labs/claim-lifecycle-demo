evidence_type: "performance_validation"

summary: >
  This evidence validates Claim 001 by reporting a model evaluation run in which
  the observed accuracy meets or exceeds the declared performance threshold.

observed_metrics:
  metric: "accuracy"
  value: 0.84
  threshold: 0.82
  comparator: ">="

    description: "Evaluation run artifacts including metrics, configuration, and environment information for the validated model run."

evaluation_context:
  model_id: "model-v1.0"
  dataset_id: "dataset-D"
  evaluation_protocol: "single-run evaluation using fixed random seed"
  split: "held-out test set"

provenance:

notes:
  - The reported accuracy satisfies the threshold declared in Claim 001.
  - This evidence requests promotion of the claim state from proposed to supported.
  - Subsequent evidence may contradict or supersede this validation.
