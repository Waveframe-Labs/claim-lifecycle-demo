evidence_id: "ev-004-superseded"

claim_id: "claim-001"

intended_transition:
  from: "contradicted"
  to: "superseded"

evidence_type: "claim_reformulation_and_replacement"

summary: >
  This evidence supersedes Claim 001 by introducing a refined formulation of the
  original claim and an improved evaluation protocol that resolves the previously
  observed inconsistency between supporting and contradicting results.

superseding_claim:
  new_claim_id: "claim-002"
  relationship: "replacement"
  rationale: >
    The original claim did not sufficiently constrain the evaluation protocol and
    data preprocessing steps. A refined claim with stricter controls is required.

    description: "Improved evaluation run artifacts produced under the revised protocol and controlled preprocessing pipeline."

evaluation_context:
  model_id: "model-v1.1"
  dataset_id: "dataset-D"
  evaluation_protocol: "revised protocol with fixed preprocessing and controlled randomness"
  split: "held-out test set"

provenance:
  submitter: "human"
  submission_method: "manual_demo_submission"

notes:
  - This transition demonstrates that claims are not only contradicted but may be
    formally replaced by improved formulations.
  - Supersession preserves the full historical record of the original claim and
    its supporting and contradicting evidence.
  - Follow-on work should introduce the new claim object referenced by
    superseding_claim.new_claim_id.
